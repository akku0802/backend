# Getting Started with Daily Task Planer

This project is broken up into a backend and frontend. The backend contains the Django project which uses the Django Rest Framework to host a simple API. The frontend uses React and queries data from the API.

Run the following commands to get started:

`virtualenv env`<br />
`pip install -r requirements.txt`<br />
`cd frontend`<br />
`npm run build`<br />
`cd .`<br />
`python manage.py makemigrations` <br />
`python manage.py migrate `<br />
`python manage.py runserver`<br />
